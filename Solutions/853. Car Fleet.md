## Intuition

**Key ideas:**
- The **position** determines the order of arrival.
- We can **calculate the arrival time** for each car.
- If a **previous car has a faster arrival time**, it will be **stuck behind the slower car**, so they form a **single fleet**.

---

## Approach

My approach was to **combine both arrays into a single array of pairs** so we can **sort it by position** while also keeping track of the speed.  
Once sorted, we **count backwards** to determine how many distinct fleets will reach the target:
- The **car closest to the target** forms a fleet on its own.
- For each subsequent car, if its **arrival time is greater than the previous fleet's time**, it becomes a **new fleet**.
- Otherwise, it merges with the fleet ahead.

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:**  
- **O(n log n)** — where *n* is the number of cars. The time complexity is dominated by the **sorting step**.

**Space Complexity:**  
- **O(n)** — to store the array of **position-speed pairs**.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), key=lambda x: x[0])
        last = cars.pop()
        last_time = (target - last[0]) / last[1]
        car_fleet = 1
        
        while cars:
            cur = cars.pop()
            cur_time = (target - cur[0]) / cur[1]
            if cur_time > last_time:
                car_fleet += 1
            else:
                cur_time = last_time
            last_time = cur_time
        
        return car_fleet
