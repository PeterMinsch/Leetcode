## Intuition

**Brute Force:**  
My first thought was brute forcing the solution and coming up with **O(n²)** time complexity, but I knew it would be too slow. I was stuck on this problem for a while until my student mentioned a **monotonic stack**.

**Monotonic Stack:**  
A special type of stack that maintains elements in a specific order.

I had no idea how that would help us, but then I realized if we kept the order of each element we visited, we could eventually compare the current temperature with previous temperatures and calculate the days between the previous temperature and the next warmer temperature.

## Approach

**Steps:**
1. Loop through the temperatures list.
2. Compare the current temperature with previous temperatures.
3. If the current temperature is hotter than the previous, we found the next warmer day.
4. Calculate the number of days between and store them in the answer array.
5. Push the current index onto the stack.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity
- The stack is **monotonic decreasing**, which means the coldest temperature will be at the top of the stack, allowing quick access.
- Each temperature is **pushed and popped once**, making it **O(n)** overall.

### Space Complexity
- **Result Array:** Stores `n` integers → **O(n)**.
- **Stack:** Stores `n` indices → **O(n)**.
- **Total Space Complexity = O(n) + O(n) = O(n)**.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []  # this will keep track of the indices
        answer = [0] * len(temperatures)

        for i in range(len(temperatures)):
            while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] < temperatures[i]:
                answer[stack[-1]] = i - stack[-1]
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(i)
        
        return answer
